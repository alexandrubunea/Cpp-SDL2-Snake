# Snake Game

A reproduction of the classic game "Snake", this game is built without using any modern engine like Unity or Unreal. The
game is using the SDL2 library to handle the rendering.
To play this game is required to use a keyboard. The player will control the snake with the keys W, A, S, and D to move and
the purpose is to eat as many red dots(apples) as you can to mark a higher and higher score. The score will be reduced to 0 if
the snake bites his own tail.
